4 Algorithms, namely :-
    1)Merge Sort
    2)Quick Sort
    3)Heap Sort
    4)Bubble sort
    
 have been visualized.
 
 
 A random array of numbers is generated and then they are sorted into ascending order by using various sorting method.
 
 I would like to clarify most of the code for Merge Sort and Heap sort is from Stack overflow.
 Bubble sort and Quick Sort code is used as it is from a book i found online.
 
 I wanted my webpage to look a particular way so I made it this way.
 
 I am new to React and it was Actually amazing to use React.js.
 Will try to make more projects in React.js.
 
This was my way of making Data Structures intresting for me.

I do have a certain mastery and a better understanding of Data Structures as well as JavaScript now.

Thank you!
